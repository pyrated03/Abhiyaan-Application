## Why I want to work in the team:
Cars driving on their own was something beyond imagination a few years ago. That becoming reality is something really fascinating to me. This is the main reason I want to join this team. Moreover, I would get a chance to learn and work with many different technologies. Abhiyaan, being a competitive team, will also give me the opportunity to take part in different competitions. Last but not the least, I would be able to interact with many people working in this field which shall give me a lot of exposure and insights into the field of automated driving.

PS: Tesla is working on this :P
